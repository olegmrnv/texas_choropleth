# texas_choropleth

This repository used as a part of project texas_dream (https://github.com/olegmrnv/texas_dream). Here I started working on choropleth for Texas Unemployment and Income. Later on this became repository for clean code and deployment to Heroku: https://texas-multi-choropleth.herokuapp.com/
